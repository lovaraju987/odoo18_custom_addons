# KPI Form Editability - Debugging Steps

## Current Issue
The KPI forms are not editable even for admin users. Debug info shows empty values for user and is_admin field.

## Root Cause Identified
**LIKELY ISSUE: Record Rules are preventing form editing**

The record rules in `security/kpi_tracking_rules.xml` are very restrictive and likely preventing new record creation:

1. **User Rule**: Requires `assigned_user_ids` to contain current user OR `report_id.assigned_employee_ids.user_id` to equal current user
2. **Manager Rule**: Requires `department` to equal user's department OR report assignment

**Problem**: When creating a NEW KPI, these fields are empty, so the rules block access!

## Changes Made for Testing

### 1. Removed All readonly Conditions
- All form fields now have no `readonly="not is_admin"` restrictions
- Removed group restrictions from `manual_value` field
- Removed visibility restrictions from auto tracking section

### 2. Disabled Record Rules (Temporarily)
- Commented out both `rule_kpi_user_own_kpis` and `rule_kpi_manager_by_department`
- This removes the domain restrictions that were blocking new record creation

### 3. Simplified is_admin Logic
- Set `is_admin = True` for all users (temporary debugging)

## Testing Steps

**Please upgrade the module and test:**

1. **Upgrade Module**: Apps → KPI Tracking → Upgrade
2. **Clear Browser Cache** or use incognito mode
3. **Test Creating New KPI**:
   - Go to KPI Dashboard → Reports → New
   - Try entering data in the form fields
   - **Expected Result**: Fields should now be editable

4. **Test Editing Existing KPI**:
   - Open an existing KPI record
   - Try modifying the fields
   - **Expected Result**: Fields should be editable

## What Each Test Tells Us

| Test Result | What It Means | Next Action |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| ✅ Fields are editable | Record rules were the issue | Fix record rules properly |
| ❌ Still not editable | Deeper issue exists | Investigate further |

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If Fields Are Now Editable ✅
The issue was the record rules. We need to:
1. Fix the record rules to allow new record creation
2. Restore the proper readonly logic
3. Re-enable appropriate security

### If Fields Are Still Not Editable ❌
We need to investigate:
1. Model-level constraints
2. Field definitions
3. Odoo 18 form view changes
4. JavaScript/UI issues

## Current File States

**Modified Files:**
- `views/kpi_views.xml` - Removed readonly conditions
- `models/kpi_report.py` - Set is_admin = True for all
- `security/kpi_tracking_rules.xml` - Disabled record rules

**Test and Report Back:**
Please test the form now and let me know if the fields are editable!
