# KPI Tracking Module

## üîç Overview

The **KPI Tracking** module is a comprehensive performance management system for Odoo 18 that enables organizations to define, monitor, and evaluate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across different departments. It supports both manual data entry and automatic calculations with sophisticated formula evaluation.

## üõ† Data Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `kpi.report` | Main KPI definition with calculation logic |
| `kpi.report.group` | KPI grouping and department organization |
| `kpi.report.submission` | Individual KPI submission history |
| `kpi.report.group.submission` | Group-level performance history |

---

## üîê Security Groups

| Group | Permissions | Access Level |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **KPI Admin** | Full control of all KPIs, groups, and submissions | Create, Read, Write, Delete |
| **KPI Manager** | Department/group KPIs management | Create, Read, Write |
| **KPI User** | Assigned KPIs only | Read, Submit values |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Manual KPI Setup**
1. Create a Report Group for your department
2. Define KPI with type 'Manual'
3. Set target type and target value
4. Assign users who will submit values
5. Configure email reminders if needed

### **Automatic KPI Setup**
1. Create KPI with type 'Auto'
2. Select source model (e.g., sale.order, crm.lead)
3. Define filter field for date filtering
4. Set filter type (today, this week, this month)
5. Write domain filter for record selection
6. Create formula using available variables:
   - `count_a`: Total records in base domain
   - `count_b`: Records matching filtered domain
   - `records`: Actual record objects
   - `assigned_user`: Current assigned user
   - `today`: Current date

### **Formula Examples**
```python
# Percentage calculation
(count_b / count_a) * 100

# Sum of amounts
sum(record.amount_total for record in records)

# Average calculation
sum(record.amount_total for record in records) / len(records) if records else 0

# Conditional logic
sum(record.amount_total for record in records if record.state == 'sale')
```
